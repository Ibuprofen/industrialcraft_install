Hey,

Step one, assuming you're using winblows:
https://minecraft.net/

You need to go there and purchase the game.

Then go here and download it:
http://minecraft.net/download

Download the file, then open it. 
Eventually you will reach a screen that says "Minecraft launcher 1.2.5" or similar.

In the bottom left, click edit profiles.

Under 'use version', roll down to "release 1.6.2". Select that.

Save profile.

Click play.

 Run all the way though. Get to where you actually start a new single-player world. Quit out.

Now for the fun part.
A modloader (forge) has to be installed, then on top of that, you install the mod itself (industrialcraft). Fairly simple, but the steps are important to follow.

Download this file:
http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/minecraftforge-installer-1.6.2-9.10.1.871.jar

Run it.

Install client. Wait for happiness.

Open up the game again (the Minecraft.jar that you downloaded earlier and ran) (the game itself). Once you reach the loader, in the bottom left, it says "Profile" You need to click the dropdown on profile. Select Forge. Log in again.

Open the game all the way up into your world again. Exit out.

Now install the mod.

Click Start and in the search enter `%appdata%\.minecraft\` and click the minecraft folder

Navigate to the mods folder

Download this file:
http://ic2.player.to:8080/job/IC2_lf/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/packages/industrialcraft-2_1.118.401-lf.jar

Place that file in the mods folder.

Exit all.

Run game again, it should indicate (at some point) 4-mods active.

Hit muliplayer.

Hit add server.

Enter: <ask_for_server_ip> (name it whatever you want)

Connect to the server.

It should error out.

FINAL STEP:
(close the game)

There is a file in  %appdata%\.minecraft\minecraft\config\ named IC2.cfg

Open that file and edit the beginning of it to match this file: http://pastebin.com/k9g1avXB

Lines 7-44 need to match. Use a text editor for this. Save your changes.

Boot the game.

You should be able to log in to the server. I may need your username on minecraft before it allows you in. Let me know what that is.

Questions?
